1. We create an Interface ( either Java Interface or Abstract class to create object) , and let subclasses implementing above factory 
to decide which type of object ,we need to instantiate .
In Java, constructors are not polymorphic, but by allowing subclass to create an object, we are adding polymorphic behavior to the instantiation.
In short, we are trying to achieve Pseudo polymorphism by letting the subclass to decide what to create, 
and so this Factory method is also called a virtual constructor.
