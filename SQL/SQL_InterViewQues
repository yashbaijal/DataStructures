2nd Max salary:
select max(salary) as secondHighestSalary from  employee where salary < (select max(salary) from  employee);

=======================================
Nth Maximum salary :

1. Approach 1:

select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc limit 1 offset 1 ;

select IFNULL((select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc limit 1 offset 1),NULL) as secondHighestSalary;

above query handle those cases where all salary are equal and we get null as secondhighest salary--> hence
IFNULL is used.
Distinct is used to eliminate duplicate values.
-> offset values can be set as per need like 1 for second highest, 2 for third highest.

2. Approach 2:

select salary as secondHighestSalary from (select salary , dense_rank() over (order by salary desc ) as result from employee ) temp where temp.result=2;
